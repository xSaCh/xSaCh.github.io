# 👋 hey internet, i'm samarth

software engineer who occasionally makes mobile apps. currently building scalable systems and pretending to understand distributed systems.

*uses debian btw* (when not gaming) 🐧

## work experience

### Flutter Developer @ Employee Forums (Nov 2024 - present)
- Optimized app performance by identifying and resolving critical bottlenecks
- Developed reusable components, streamlining code maintainability and reducing development time for future features

### Flutter Developer @ Xingoda (May 2024 - Aug 2024)
- Integrated Firebase and RazorPay payment gateway, implemented various app modules

## things i've built (that actually work)

### 🔐 e2e encrypted messaging
- built because every project in student group subject should be unqiue
- handles multiple clients without exploding
- websockets actually working in prod (yes, i'm bragging)
- tech: flutter, python, fastapi, mongodb

### 🔍 deepmelanoma
won 3 hackathons because... well, AI. but seriously:
- 90% accuracy in detecting skin cancer
- runs locally because who needs cloud costs
- tech: flutter, tflite

### 🤖 treasurehunt bot
telegram bot that doesn't spam you with crypto ads
- handles multiple teams without chaos
- qr codes for that extra "tech" feel
- actually logs stuff (because debugging in prod is fun)
- tech: python, sqlite

## "i built it from scratch because i could" corner 🛠️

small projects where i refuse to use libraries because "i want to understand how it works":

- **voxel-engine**: wanna be minecraft but let's settle here
- **chip-8-emulator**: first prj that's works as intended
- **intcode-assembler**: fancy gui for vm
- **raycast-engine**: uses some fancy algorithms and math equations

## when not coding

- building my "open world game" (2020 status: can shoot things, enemies exist)
- watching movies that make me go "wait, what?" (inception, arrival) or cliche bollywood because why not
- setting up and customizing my linux distro (again)

## currently learning

- kubernetes (docker-compose wasn't complicated enough)
- distributed systems (monolith is a myth)
